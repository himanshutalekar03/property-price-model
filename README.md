# Property Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a simple machine learning model that predicts property prices based on a dataset of real estate features. The model was developed using **Linear Regression** and implemented in **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to predict the price of a property based on key features provided in the dataset. This serves as an introduction to regression modeling and machine learning.

### Key Features:
- **Model:** Linear Regression
- **Dataset:** Includes features such as Building_class , zoning_class, Lot_extent and many more.
- **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
- **Performance:** Evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) , R-squared , Adj_Rsquare and MSE.
